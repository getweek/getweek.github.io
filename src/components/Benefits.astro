    <h2>Multiple time slots</h2>
     You canâ€™t always complete a task in one go; sometimes you need to take a
    break or switch to a more important activity. In Week each task can be
    planned multiple times - as many as you want.

     Sometimes, you plan to work on a project, but you don't know which specific
    tasks you're going to do. In Week, you can allocate a time box for an
    activity and fill it with tasks later automatically or manually.
